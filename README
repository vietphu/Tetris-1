Since the great HDD failure of 2010, there's been a severe lack of motivation to re-do this project. What lies in this repo is what i've gotten around to re-building so far.

This project is an (take a deep breath)  open-source, object-oriented, cross-platform, native C++ implementation of the core Tetris-style game logic, with some room for feature additions.

HOW TO BUILD

#1. Download Cmake.
#2. As soon as I actually add Cmake, I'll put something meaningful here.
